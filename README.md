# Armada Cleanup Crew
Armada Cleanup Crew is a Katamari-esque game developed using Unity. In this game, you control a sphere, which is in charge of cleaning space junk off the space armada's mothership. However, for your promotion, you have to defeat the other sphere(s) who want to also get promoted. You have 90 seconds to clean off as much junk as you can! Whoever has the most junk after this time is declared winner!
